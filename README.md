# Influence of Valence on Prospective Memory: A Neurophysiological Perspective on LPP Amplitude
Project for lab rotation Cognitive Neuroscience at RPTU

Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to remember and carry out intentions in the future. Forgetting to conduct important planned intentions (e.g., turning off the stove, sending a file before a deadline) can have significant negative impacts, so studies have been focusing on factors affecting PM performance. Emotional factors, for example, have been studied in recent years and exhibited controversial findings, and the research on the associated electrophysiological markers remain limited. Therefore, this study, by involving emotional materials, aims to explore the effects of these materials on PM performance and event-related potential (ERP) component late positive potential (LPP).

 ## Hypotheses
1. Accuracy: The accuracy is expected to be similar across different valence conditions.
2. Reaction time (RT): We expect to find a main effect of valence on the RTs with slower RTs for neutral condition.
3. ERP: The late positive potential (LPP) component is assumed to reflect sustained attention toward the emotional materials. Therefore, this proposal hypothesizes an elevated LPP at Pz within the time window of 300 to 1,000ms post-PM cues.
